# AniMatch: A Content-Based Anime Recommendation System

**Authors**: Berkay Orhan, Jonatan Ebenholm

## Abstract

AniMatch is a content-based recommendation system designed to suggest anime titles based on their inherent features. The system employs BERT embeddings to extract meaningful representations of anime metadata and cosine similarity to compute relationships between titles. Unlike traditional recommendation systems, AniMatch focuses on metadata analysis, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant recommendations.
